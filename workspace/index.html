			My name is Ryan Alcantara. I was born in California and lived here my whole life. I live with my two loving parents and my two lazy dogs. I have a ton of hobbies. Most of the time I spend watching movies and tv shows. I love to watch tv shows such as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, and Band of Brothers. I also enjoy watching movies such as Mad Max, Logan, and Get Out. Finally I occasionaly watch anime. My friends and I love to watch movies and eat out, especially at places like Korean BBQ. When I'm with my family, I usually enjoy traveling to other places and camping. After my long day at school I go to hell and start running at Track. After Track, I come home to usually relax on my computer and homework.			</p>
